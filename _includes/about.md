### Hi, I’m Dave Seeman.

Born in Cincinnati OH, raised in Franklin TN, studied and stayed in Knoxville TN.

  I take from my father, who was an inventor of sorts. The family affectionately calls him MacGyver. I was bustling with ideas when I was in high school so I decided to study Mechanical Engineering so I could turn my ideas into realities. During my studies, I realized that meant I wanted to be an entrepreneur. So I changed focus. I co-founded a company called Willow List, learned a lot, “failed fast" (do we really brag about that?), and now I work as a Design Engineer and do lots of projects on the side.

  I’m married to this beautiful girl in the picture below; her name is Kimberly. I swear sometimes that she’s a dream. We love to get outside together and enjoy the mountains near Knoxville. Outside of work I try to spend a few weekends here and there hiking or sailing though I can’t do the latter nearly as often as I’d like. I’m currently taking a hiatus from volunteer activities but I hope to soon return to tutoring high school kids in math and science.

All the best,
Dave
