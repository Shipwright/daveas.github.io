### Hi, Iâ€™m Dave Seeman.

I'm an Engineer living in Knoxville, TN with my wife, Kimberly (that's her recently in the picture below).

I take from my father, who was an inventor of sorts. I studied Mechanical Engineering to turn my ideas for products into tangible products. I am also a wannabe designer, marketer, and programmer. If anything, I am an autodidact[^1].

[^1]: Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education is the act of teaching oneself about a subject or subjects in which one has had little to no formal education. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism)
