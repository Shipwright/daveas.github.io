excerpt: "For my first post-undergraduate interview I has to present an idea. I made a presentation but on top of that I decided it would be my first real attempt to create a website (or single page) that someone would actually see. Most of the code is not mine but the content provided my first exploration into html & css."

### The Idea
In my first interview we had discussed creating a small group within the company to pilot internal projects. So for my presentation I suggested a name and logo for the group and a first project which would be a bit of a publicity stunt in partnership with a major retailer that happened to be coming to the area soon (REI).

The idea of the project was that we would design, build, and install a [bike sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_sharing_system) station and REI would supply the bikes. Both companies would have their names on the structure to bolster their brand with outdoor enthusiasts.

For my presentation I made the logo & name, the slideshow, and my first web page (based largely on a template).

### Logo & Name:

The company is called "Strata-G" so for the group I created a similar logo under the name "Laborator-E". To do this I used an awesome service called [What Font Is](http://www.whatfontis.com) to find a similar and *free* font. The logo design itself was done in Illustrator.
