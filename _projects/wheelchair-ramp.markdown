excerpt: "It was a requirement at my high school to do a 25 hour community service project. I had a good idea I wanted to be an engineer so I decided to ask my mom (a doctor) if I could help one of her patients for whom she was making house visits. The patient was elderly and needed a wheelchair ramp in order to leave his home with his wife."
