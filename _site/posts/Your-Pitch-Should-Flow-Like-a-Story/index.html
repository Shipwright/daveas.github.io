    <p>I’ve read just about every article that exists (to date) on how to craft your pitch. The more recent posts shy away from hockey stick projections and instead focus on making your pitch engaging by creating a story. That’s nice and all, but I’m kind of tired of how much people are talking about stories these days. Every how-to article on pitching, marketing, or selling, has become all about telling a story and most of those articles don’t actually tell you what the first step in how to tell a good story. You see, story telling is not a ubiquitous skill. Haven’t you ever heard of the struggling writer? We need a better strategy, one that starts from a place of action.</p>

<p>So I thought I’d take a stab at it.</p>

<p>Your pitch <em>is</em> a story, but that’s not a helpful way to think about it. Instead, think of it as, “your pitch should <em>flow</em> like a story”, and stories have plots. This is a subtle change, but it has significant implications. It simply means that the segments of your pitch should feel like a story, where one event leads to another in a grand plot. The segments should be known to you in order to craft your pitch. You have to know how the story begins and ends. In the example below I use the outline set fourth by Guy Kawasaki in “The Art of The Start” to build out each segment. Now that I know each segment, I can write the story.</p>

<p><img src="http://postachio-images.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/357b9a078a599b955d8ae995b8346a0b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In my pitch I usually open with a “day in the life” story of customer of ours, a young and in-love couple who get engaged and decide to go register for gifts. I explain how the process sucks and why Willow List makes it better. By using the customer story to explain the “pain and gain” and more importantly, the uniqueness or “underlying magic” of the business model, the story of my business now unfolds (Hint: if there is a climax in this story, it should be at the end of the customer story, when you share your unique solution. If this part isn’t a giant leap beyond the state of the art, you may have already lost). Having talked about our customer, I move onto the market opportunity with how many customers there are with the same problem. A natural progression. This talk about millions of customers leads nicely to the fact that there are others vying for their attention. I deviate here from Guy’s order of operations for the sake of telling a story that flow nicely. Now that I’ve touched on the competition, I have to make an argument that I can garner the customer’s attention better than they can with a nice marketing and sales strategy. Now the story has moved into some real life action, people have to carry out the operations I have just finished talking about, which transitions nicely into a discussion about the management team. By this point, the story is pretty much told, and you’re just tying up loose ends. I hit quickly but deliberately our stats and use of funds, and depending on the investor, I talk about our financial projections. I think that’s enough for a compelling story. If they want to know more, they can read the sequel, aka the appendix slides that talk about key metrics, market trends, etcetera. These are important details, but remember, investors know what questions to ask. You have to leave some of the details out just to show that when asked, you have the answer, because it’s impossible to give every detail in your pitch without losing interest.</p>

<p>On that note, if you don’t know something, it’s best to just say so.</p>

<p>I hope that helps you figure out how to <em>actually</em> make your pitch <em>sound like</em> a story.</p>
