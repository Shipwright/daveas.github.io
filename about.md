# 5 Reasons Why You're Here

Why do I even have a website? It's not because I think anyone cares about what I have to say. There are a few reasons.
1. I believe in transparency. If you want to learn more about me, it's not hard to start. (Hint: keep reading)
2. I like social media, but sometimes I get a little of seeing everyone's ideal self. A website is a place where you can be your genuine self, and only those interested in that person have to see it.
3. I love writing even though I'm not the best writer. I think it is a wonderful practice to keep your mind sharp.
4. I appreciate all of the blogs that I read, and on the off chance I have something to say that someone finds valuable, I want to share it.
