I was delighted last december when I received an email that said I had made it to the top 5% of Pocket Readers in 2013. They even [prepared a page](http://getpocket.com/stats/vTtV6fM?utm_source=bronto&utm_medium=email&utm_term=All+Dynamic+Links&utm_content=%25%25first_name%25%25,+you+made+the+Top+%25%25top_percentile%25%25%25+of+readers+on+Pocket+this+year!&utm_campaign=EOY+User+Stats+(With+Name)) from [Pocket](http://twitter.com/pocket) for me where they said:

>You've read 327,071 words in Pocket this year. That's like reading the Great Gatsby 7 times
Nice work!
And if the pages from those books were stacked end to end, they'd make it past the top of the Empire State Building

This message made me feel so good! And therein lies a great marketing lesson.

If your product makes your user a [better version of his or her self](https://blog.bufferapp.com/people-dont-buy-products-they-buy-better-versions-of-themselves), and you can clearly communicate that value - then you have a rock solid marketing message. Especially when, like Pocket, you collect some data to create a unique and powerful message to an individual customer.

So thank you pocket staff, for making me a better reader, and teaching me a great marketing lesson!
