title: "Setting New Standards of Excellence"

I have this limiting habit that was engrained in me as a child and teenager. On sports teams I was always the fastest so I was expected to finish first. Now I tend to think getting done first is a sign of excellence.

But I want to establish a new standard for myself. As I've started working I have noticed that being the person who notices things that no one else does is perhaps a better standard of excellence. Catch the error. Notice your boss's effort. Remember your coworker's preferences. Just be the one who notices what no one else has.

This is my new goal. I'm excited to see how it plays out.


Have any advice for a recent grad? What is your measuring stick?
