1. Is it disruptive?
2. Is it scalable?
3. Is it defensible?

These are the three questions my partner Scott warned me I would get. Lo and behold, I was exclusively asked these questions, in one way or another.

I enjoyed our meeting, and apparently they enjoyed it enough to ask us back. But I believe we are really just trying to make ourselves known. Maybe down the road we will really be able to work together, but for right now we just need some seed money for an MVP.

### DOODLING

In other news, I sat down with a guy named Chad Marcum who wanted to help me figure out how to create a better pitch for Willow List. He and I spent about an hour storyboarding the pitch.

It starts off introducing our main characters, the bride and groom, and continues to visually tell their story. I really liked what we came up with, and I can't wait to put it into practice. You can see the photos below:
