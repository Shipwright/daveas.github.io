  <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Dave Seeman.</h3>
  <p>I'm a Design Engineer living in Knoxville, TN with my wife, Kimberly (that's us below).
  Besides being an engineer, I am also a wannabe designer, marketer, and programmer.
  If anything, I just have too many interests.
  Most of these turn into projects because I have fun when I'm learning and making something new.</p>
