excerpt: "I wanted to work on a CAD project during my summer co-op with Duke Energy. So I looked around for a place I could create something of value and decided that I could reduce the downtime of a piece of equipment by building a simple lift rig."

### The Rig:

The piece of equipment is called an [SCR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_catalytic_reduction) or *Selective Catalytic Reducer*. It contains "logs" of what Vanadium Penta-Oxide which catalyses the reduction NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>x</sub> (very nasty things) in the flue gas produced by the combustion of coal.

These logs had to be lowered, replaced, and raised over 100 feet, one at a time, 1000s of times, in order to rejuvinate the SCR during downtime. By using a simple cage to move SCR logs, we could reduce the time to change them out by a factor of 4.

I wanted a design that would allow one to lift 1, 2, 3, *or* 4 logs without creating a static imbalance in the rig, but my coworker wisely advised me not to over engineer the rig :grin:

This is what I came up with (the four blue rectangular prisms are the catalyst logs).
