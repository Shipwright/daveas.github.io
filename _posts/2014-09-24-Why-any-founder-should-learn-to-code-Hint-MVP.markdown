As a recent grad who is no longer running a business, I am looking to join one. In my job search I came across a very cool company that seemed to be very active in launching new ventures and projects. It just so happens I had met one of their employees in the past so I reached out to her to see if they were hiring.

Luckily, she was gracious enough to forward along my information and we eventually got to talking. Their interview process (which is not quite over) involved coming up with a project for the company so I created a simple one-page website to showcase my project. I also used some design skills I picked up while working on Willow List to make this nifty logo:

### The Value of Coding

I am currently reading [Without Their Permission](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455520020/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1455520020&linkCode=as2&tag=willis0d-20&linkId=4AUMJC6MB4F3OGYS) by Alexis Ohanian who is a big proponent of the "build first" methodology for startups. By creating a super basic version of your idea and showing it to people, you can get a much bigger reaction than just talking about an idea. The best part is, as Alexis consistently points out, **anyone can do this!** I put in about 15 hours+ on Codeacademy (so far!) and now I can quickly put together a one-page website to communicate ideas to anyone anywhere in the world. Amazing!

So here it is, my minimum viable product for the project I created for my interview. It may not look good in every browser or on every device, but remember, I'm new at this! You can find it at [laboratore.godownwind.co](http://laboratore.godownwind.co).

_Full disclosure:_ at the time of this writing I am still speaking with said company, hence I did not disclose their name!

P.S. - I created this page using the â€œPages" feature of GitHub. You can find me on GitHub [here](http://github.com/dseeman) - and a future post is coming on how to use this GitHub feature to easily create static one-page websites for your next project!
