We use GrabCAD at work, and I have many times thought it would be nice to have an API. So I reached out to the nice folks at GrabCAD and they asked if I could gather some research for them.

To do so I created [this survey](http://grabcad-api.daveaseeman.com) - if you're an engineer and a programmer, please take a look!

In the meantime, for those of you who use GrabCAD and Chrome, I also created a chrome app that forwards to GrabCAD workbench. You can get it [here]() and see the source [here]().
