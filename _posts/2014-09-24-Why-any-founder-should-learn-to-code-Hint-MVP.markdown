title: Why any founder should learn to code (Hint: MVP)

<p>As a recent grad who is no longer running a business, I am looking to join one. In my job search I came across a very cool company that seemed to be very active in launching new ventures and projects. It just so happens I had met one of their employees in the past so I reached out to her to see if they were hiring.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Luckily, she was gracious enough to forward along my information and we eventually got to talking. Their interview process (which is not quite over) involved coming up with a project for the company so I created a simple one-page website to showcase my project. I also used some design skills I picked up while working on <a href="http://godownwind.co/tag/willowlist">Willow List</a> to make this nifty logo:</p>

<h3>The Value of Coding</h3>
<h1></h1>
<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455520020/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1455520020&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=willis0d-20&amp;linkId=4AUMJC6MB4F3OGYS">Without Their Permission</a> by Alexis Ohanian who is a big proponent of the "build first" methodology for startups. By creating a super basic version of your idea and showing it to people, you can get a much bigger reaction than just talking about an idea. The best part is, as Alexis consistently points out, <strong>anyone can do this!</strong> I put in about 15 hours+ on Codeacademy (so far!) and now I can quickly put together a one-page website to communicate ideas to anyone anywhere in the world. Amazing!</p>

<p>So here it is, my minimum viable product for the project I created for my interview. It may not look good in every browser or on every device, but remember, I'm new at this! You can find it at <a href="http://laboratore.godownwind.co">laboratore.godownwind.co</a>.</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure:</em> at the time of this writing I am still speaking with said company, hence I did not disclose their name!</p>

<p>P.S. - I created this page using the â€œPages" feature of GitHub. You can find me on GitHub <a href="http://github.com/dseeman">here</a> - and a future post is coming on how to use this GitHub feature to easily create static one-page websites for your next project!</p>
