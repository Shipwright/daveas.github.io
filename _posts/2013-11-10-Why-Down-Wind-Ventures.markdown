During my last summer in college I took the trip of my life and went kayaking and sailing in British Columbia, Canada through the <a href="http://www.nols.edu/about/leadership/">National Outdoor Leadership School</a>. I spent a lot of time thinking about my life at home, and while I was gone I read a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885167776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1885167776&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=willis0d-20">The One Thing</a>, which challenged me to find the one thing I am called to do. While sailing down wind in the Strait of Georgia on a 36â€™ boat, my heart settled on the, albeit, broad concept, of turning ideas into businesses.</p>
<p>Down Wind Ventures, and this site godownwind co, is an experiment in self-branding. I aspire to be a serial entrepreneur and I intend to keep the name as a temporary shelter for fledgling ideas. I even hope to one day, after paying my dues and hopefully finding some success, invest in other companies under a similar name. </p>
