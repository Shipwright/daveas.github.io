For most engineers, “engineering" is not quotidian. It usually matters a lot more if you can "talk to people" rather than “engineer things", as it goes with so many other jobs. I believe there are many jobs out there that require engineering degrees that simply don’t have to. There should be a faster route to access many of these jobs which are in desperate need of more candidates. Why isn’t there a 2-3 year track that attempts to make one literate in all kinds of engineering with more practical knowledge than fundamental knowledge? A person with that sort of background would make an excellent sales person, for example.

I mean really, if you’re an engineer you have to love that meme. It’s so true! I think we over-glorify engineering. There are people out there who truly engineer amazing things, but those people are not nearly as common as the rest. The ones who are actually quite content not being among the creative minority. Why don’t we glorify engineering literacy, much like we are starting to push (perhaps over-glorify) [coding literacy](http://m.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)? I mean, why is it that most _new engineering graduates_ could not fix a carburator or program an arduino? If you’re not a recent grad that might surprise you, but these people are the minority. There has to be a faster, better way to take a person from high school education to engineering literate in less than four years. We desperately need it.
