excerpt: "It was a requirement at my high school to do a 25 hour community service project. I had a good idea I wanted to be an engineer so I decided to ask my mom (a doctor) if I could help one of her patients for whom she was making house visits. The patient was elderly and needed a wheelchair ramp in order to leave his home with his wife."

### Design
I started off by going to the house to take detailed measurements. It turns out that was a good thing because although not visible to the naked eye, the entire stoop was extremely uneven. I made sketches and took notes to bring them home to calculate the necessary dimensions of the ramp.

Next I had to look up all of the city, state, and federal codes regarding wheel chair ramps. There were requirements for the length of a given incline, the slope of those inclines, and the area of platforms. I factored in all of these requirements to the design:

The physical and code constraints were such that I had to build two ramps and a platform in between. I decided to build these such that the three parts could be assembled on site, making it easier to move them from my home to theirs. With everything in place, I drew my models again with dimensions and all, and extrapolated the requirements for materials. Every screw  was accounted for and I even optimized exact amount of each board I would have to buy in order to minimize the scrap left over from cutting.

### Construction

I went out to both Lowe's & Home Depot for materials and explained my project to the respective managers. I asked for a discount to reduce the burden on the patient, who was already paying for the material on top of medical bills. The cost of the parts was about $500. Home Depot offered a $25 coupon, Lowe's offered 50%. And now, thanks to their 10x generosity, I'll shop at Lowe's for as long as I live. Here's what I had to buy:

What was a 25 hour requirement ended up being 25 hours just in design and planning, and another 50 from me and 50 from my dad in construction. Before the proejct I could use a drill and a saw but my use lacked elegance. Afterwards, I felt like a professional, on my way to being a craftsman. I knew I was far from it, but it was enough that I decided to become an engineer. You can see some pictures below from the construction phase that show the different techniques we used to ensure part quality.

### Installation

My dad and I loved working on this project together and it was a sweet moment when the installation went perfectly. Everything fit and it looked fantastic. And most importantly, this family could now leave their home and experience the world again.
