    <p>February 18th, I get a call from the jeweler in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>In a thick Colorado accept that sounds almost Canadian he calmly informs me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey there Dave, this is Bill. Just wanted to let ya know that Kimberly’s ring is done early so you should have it by Thursday.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Panic Set In. I had been planning to ask her two weeks from this Saturday! Would everyone be able to make it in? Can I pull off the plan?</p>

<p>Well as these things go, there’s your plan, and then there is God’s, and guess what? Yours never happens.</p>

<p>So my roommate Chase and I sit in our backyard smoking pipes that night and start to brainstorm a new plan. I’m pleased with what we come up with, though it will really be evolving all the way until it actually happens.</p>

<p>On Friday I let Natalie (Chase’s fiancé) in on the plan. She agrees to help out, and her sister, Maddie, who is in town for the weekend, also agrees to help. We subtly lead Kim to believe that she has set us up to have dinner together at the blue house (Chase and I’s home), and that the girls will be going on a mid-day excursion to plan Natalie’s first bridal shower (an excellent excuse since Nat’s sister is also her maid of honor).</p>

<p>Saturday morning comes and I take Kimberly to the mountains to an amazing waterfall that Chase recommended. I take a picture of her taking in God’s glory. She has no idea what is happening later that night.</p>

<p>We have a wonderful time in the mountains and come back to eat at Panera Bread Company. We sit and talk about marriage. In fact, we had been talking about marriage for much of the day. I was struggling to keep it all in, but as Kim tells me in hindsight, I kept it together quite well.</p>

<p>[pic of panera bread]</p>

<p>I stalled at Panera so that the timing would work out later on. After a long talk we left and headed for Knoxville.</p>

<p>I dropped Kim off at her house where her best friend Natalie and her sister picked up Kim to go plan Natalie’s shower. Natalie expertly allows Kim, yet again, to believe that she has chosen the activity - the girls are going to get manicures.</p>

<p>I head home to change and run to the river. Chase comes with me to help set up the candles and to find a good spot to take pictures. Natalie shows up a bit later to set up from another vantage point (Chase is a wonderful photographer, and so is Natalie).</p>

<p>I wait for what seems like hours until Maddie drops Kim off at the river. Kim pauses, “what are we doing, we aren’t there yet? we go straight up here to get on the intersate”. Maddie sternly tells Kim, “get out, turn left, and follow the candles”.</p>

<p>My heart starts pounding when Kim rounds the corner. She starts to cry and cover her gasping expression. When she arrives I tell her,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Kimberly, you may not have noticed, but everything we have done today, we did for a reason. I took you to the mountains because I believe that is where we fell in love. On our way back we stopped at Panera because I remember our first date at Panera when I didn’t touch my food because I was so nervous. And you got your nails done, because, well… Kimberly, you are the sweetest girl I know, and I admire how your love is a light for others. You are the only woman who can both love me so well and push me to be a better man. I know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so I am so thankful that God put us together on that rainy day. Kimberly,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I got down on one knee.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Will you marry me?”</p>
</blockquote>
