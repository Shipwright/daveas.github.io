excerpt: "This planetary gear system was part of a project in my 3D CAD class in college. The gears were cut with a waterjet and a chassis was created to rotate the gears in different variations. The gears were designed from scratch using an involut curve to profile the gear tooth."

### The Involute Gear Tooth:

Drawing the actual curve of the involute tooth was the hardest part of this project.

### Assembly:

My team of four was assigned different parts of the assembly. My portion was the pinned connection which would allow the Sun gear to be stil while the Planet and Ring gears rotated around it. Here is a gif of that in action:
