<p>I was delighted last december when I received an email that said I had made it to the top 5% of Pocket Readers in 2013. They even <a href="http://getpocket.com/stats/vTtV6fM?utm_source=bronto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=All+Dynamic+Links&amp;utm_content=%25%25first_name%25%25,+you+made+the+Top+%25%25top_percentile%25%25%25+of+readers+on+Pocket+this+year!&amp;utm_campaign=EOY+User+Stats+(With+Name)">prepared a page</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/pocket">Pocket</a> for me where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You've read 327,071 words in Pocket this year. That's like reading the Great Gatsby 7 times<br />
Nice work!</p>
<p>And if the pages from those books were stacked end to end, they'd make it past the top of the Empire State Building</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was extremely impressed with this marketing effort. Pocket made me feel good about myself, and I wonâ€™t forget it!</p>
