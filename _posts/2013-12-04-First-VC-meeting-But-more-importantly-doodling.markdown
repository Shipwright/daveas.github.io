1. Is it disruptive?
2. Is it scalable?
3. Is it defensible?

These are the three questions Scott warned me I would get. Lo and behold, I was exclusively asked these questions, in one way or another.

I enjoyed our meeting, and apparently they enjoyed it enough to ask us back. But I believe we are really just trying to make ourselves known. Maybe down the road we will really be able to work together, but for right now we just need some seed money for an MVP.

### DOODLING

In other news, I sat down with Chad Marcum to figure out how to create a better pitch for Willow List. He and I spent about an hour storyboarding the pitch.

It starts off introducing our main characters, the bride and groom.
