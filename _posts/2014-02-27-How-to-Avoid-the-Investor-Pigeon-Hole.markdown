title: How to Avoid the Investor "Pigeon Hole"
date: 2014-02-27

<p>Investors hear, read, and otherwise review hundreds if not thousands of pitches per year. For entrepreneurs, this leads to one of the most inconvenient truisms about the investor mindset. The <em>first</em> thing investors have to do is <strong>get their bearings</strong>… </p>

<h3>The Pidgeon Hole</h3>
<p>To do this, most investors will (perhaps subconsciously) try to <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pidgeon hole</a> your startup. And for 99% of entrepreneurs out there, you're not going to be the first pidgeon in any particular hole. </p>

<p>This makes it extremely important to do two things:<br />
1. Put yourself in the right hole, with the right pigeons<br />
2. Explain why you’re the most badass pigeon</p>

<h3>Step 1: The right hole, the right pigeons</h3>
<p>The first step for the entrepreneur is to claim your hole. Let's say you created <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/13/sailo-launch/">an app to help boat owners and captains make money</a> on the side like Airbnb and Uber have done for home owners and car owners, respectively. Hopefully your investors have heard of Airbnb and Uber (if not, should you reconsider?) and so they lump you into that hole. But are there companies carving out niche peer-to-peer opportunities that have proven to be profitable? Beware of the lure of the <a href="">“how is this a billion dollar company"</a> mindset of many investors. It may be simple to explain your company to other founders “we are uber for boats" but using a “this for that" high-concept pitch can actually hurt you, too. Comparing yourself to the giants of the industry may actually make you seem like an insignificant investment opportunity. You don’t have to be the next Airbnb or Uber to make a killing for you or your investors. You just have to do one thing really, really well. So do your homework and put yourself in the right hole with the right pigeons.</p>

<h3>Step 2: I am one badass pigeon</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, the idea here is not to talk about why you’re better than your competition. In fact, in the startup world you are rarely “beat" by your competition. So the point here is to address the investor’s entire purpose of listening to you: he or she wants to know how your business will create a meaningful return on their investment. Meaningful usually being at least 2x. So much has been written on this topic by people far more experienced than I so I won’t give you my two cents, exactly. But I will tell you what I’ve heard and validated for myself. You have to show them how your company will do one thing and one thing only - grow like crazy. Having a defensible position (like a patent or an all-star team) and/or early success (traction with paying customers) are the best ways to quickly make a big point about your growth potential. The best part about those two methods is that they are concrete. It doesn’t matter if the investor thinks your industry is unattractive. It doesn’t matter if the investor thinks your idea is far-fetched or illegitimate. Traction and defensibility/uniqueness speak louder than your idea itself, and they speak in first language of most investors - money. Eventually, you will meet an investor who likes your potential for a return more than she dislikes your idea or market, and that will leave her with only one reasonable option - invest!</p>
