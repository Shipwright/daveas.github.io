<p>What do ex-navy pilots and self-taught code warriors have in common? Nothing really, but I’m glad these two met. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>You see, the ex-navy pilot happens to be my partner, Scott Ewing, who is also involved in a video game company. At an event for video game enthusiasts and programmers, he ran into aforementioned self-taught code warrior and struck up a conversation. Willow List was mentioned, my partner connected me to the programmer, David Furman, and we met for coffee. He liked the idea, and I asked him to join our little startup.</p>

<p>It’s kind of sad really. The terminology for a founder who doesn’t code is “non-technical" from the title given to most coding cofounders these days - Chief Technology Officer. By that standard, I, a Mechanical Engineer, am “non-technical"! Alas, the plight of the industry of innovation - so reliant on software! I am extremely thankful to have had this serendipitous introduction, but it makes me think… in the future I had better learn how to code, at a least a little, or get involved in a more <em>physically</em> technical startup.</p>

<p>For founders out there who have not been as fortunate as I am to have a programmer actually take up interest in my company, I suggest you do one of two things. Pick up programming, or start intentionally seeking out a programmer to join you. I tried the latter on many occasions, and had just started teaching myself some HTML and CSS when I met David. A man for whom I have much respect always said “good luck is a byproduct of hard work". I don’t think I have worked <em>that</em> hard, but boy am I thankful for good luck!</p>
