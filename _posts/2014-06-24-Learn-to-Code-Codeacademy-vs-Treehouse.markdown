title: Learn to Code - Codeacademy vs. Treehouse

My analysis is simple. When you pay for Treehouse, what you’re really paying for is some more hand-holding.

Both are designed with different tracks you can follow, like learning to build a website or an iPhone app. Both involve entering specific code into an editor to determine if you’re comprehending the lessons. But for anyone with a decent aptitude for coding can do quite well with Codeacademy. The extra videos in Treehouse explain concepts in greater depth, but they also add a lot of time. I started out doing both for about a week and quickly discovered that my lessons were moving about two thirds faster in Codeacademy. So if you are self-driven to learn this new skill but are unsure of your own ability, then I would highly recommend that you do what I did and try both for about a week. If you’re feeling confident, skip straight to Codecademy.

I also recommend taking the “projects" in either suite very seriously. Don’t just do the minimum prompt. Try to add about twice as much as they ask for. Have fun with it and make it personal. I think this is where the real _learning_ happens, since the lessons themselves are just prompting you to temporarily memorize some tags and syntax. Putting them into use in the projects is the most beneficial part of the whole process!

Best of luck learning a fun new skill!
