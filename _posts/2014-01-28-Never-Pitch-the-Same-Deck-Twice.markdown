I’ve learned that what seems like a good idea whilst captivated by the aura of your presentation glowing on your computer screen late at night, may actually not be a great idea. Creating a compelling visual story for your oratory is a tough task. The good news is, it doesn’t have to be perfect from day one.

### Nothing is ever perfect

Just like your product, your pitch is never perfect. Granted, your pitch isn’t nearly as important as your product - if you have a great product that people love, then finding money (if you need any) shouldn’t be terribly hard, or so they say. That said, it is still worth putting some time into your pitch if you are in fact raising money.

### Your **pitch** is always changing

Your pitch deck should be highly visual, with few words and few numbers. It should be the essence of, the thrice distilled version of your vision. And in a startup, your vision can undergo significant changes in a matter of minutes. Maybe a new competitor changes your landscape, for better or for worse. Or maybe some customer feedback on your new features tells you you’ve struck gold and need to pivot to a new value proposition. Whatever it is, it happens often, and your pitch should always be evolving to match. Ideally, this will wane as your company becomes more mature and starts to generate real revenue. But as a founder you should be so intimately aware of your business that week by week you have some inkling of a new insight to share with a prospective investor.

### Your _business_ is always changing!

This lesson has a more far-reaching implication, and that is always be improving. Call it the lean startup if you want, but the point is that you should always be picking up on new information, incorporating it, and improving your offering, whether its to your customers or your investors.

### Keep your priorities straight

What is even more important than this tip is to focus on your business first. Yes, you can always be improving your pitch. But getting investment is not the holy grail, having happy and paying customers is. Never focus too much on how your pitch looks, although it should have at least one layer of polish. If you find yourself spending more time on slides then on your customers, you’re priorities aren’t straight!

### Examples

Below I have embedded 3 of my slide decks for Willow List. Each deck includes a date and was made specifically for the investor group to whom I presented (at least in some small way). Enjoy!
