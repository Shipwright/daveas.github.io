excerpt: "Since I started to smoke a pipe in 2010 I have wanted to design one for myself. Smoking is such an intimate and yet unchanged experience. Pipe smoking itself really hasn't changed for hundreds if not thousands of years. I found it hard tobelieve that modern materials and manufacturing did not have anything to add to the experience."

### Research:

There is a lot to know about pipes before you intend to make one of any kind. But to start off, I had to learn the basic parts of pipe, as pictured below:
![pipe parts]({{site.images}}{{ page.dir }}1.jpg)[^1]

Number | Part | Function
:---: | :--- | :---
1 | Bowl | Outer wall that holds the tobacco
2 | Chamber | Space within bowl that tobacco occupies
3 | Draught Hole | Allows passage of smoke into the bore and keeps tobacco dry
4 | Shank | Section between Bowl and Stem that shelters the Mortise  
5 | Mortise | Made to fit the outside diameter of the Tennon
6 | Tennon | Made to fit the inside diameter of the Mortise
7 | Stem | Piece with protruding Tennon, connects the Shank and Mouthpiece
8 | Mouthpiece | Made to fit the lips of the smoker
9 | Lip | Ridge made to fit inside the lip or on teeth for stability
10 | Bore | The through hole for the smoke from the chamber

Every part of the pipe must be very carefully designed to optimize the burning of the tobacco and the comfort and aesthetic of the object itself. The documenst above, "Characteristics of Briar Wood"[^2] and "On the Burning Temperatures of Tobacco"[^3] were (and still are) extraordinarily helpful in designing the pipe. Specifically in understanding how the pipe's dimensions affect the smoking quality of the pipe from the chamber diameter and depth to the thickness of the bowl and the diameter of the Draught Hole and Bore.

The bowl material and chamber dimensions are particularly important because they not only affect the feel of the object in your hand and its loft as you hold it in your mouth but the the quality of the smoke. The right dimensions allow the tobacco to burn as cool as possible without losing the "cherry" - the ongoing combustion of the tobacco. Below you can see the different zones in the chamber and get a better idea for how dimensions affect smoke quality and makeup:

This project is currently underway, so as it continues I will update this post with sketches, models, renderings, prototypes, and eventually with the product itself.
