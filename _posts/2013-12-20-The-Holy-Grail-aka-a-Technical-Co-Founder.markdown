I mentioned I got to meet with my first VC right? Here’s a little excerpt from our first conversation:

> Me - “My name is Dave, I have an idea for a web enabled company but I need money to start it"  
> VC - “Sounds interesting, do you have a technical cofounder?"  
> Me - “No, but I think we could get away with a project lead for the first several months because..."  
> VC - “Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"  
> Me - [short pause]  
> VC - "Now go-a-way, or I shall taunt you a second time-uh"

Okay so that’s not really an excerpt from our conversation but it might as well have been. In fact, it’s the feedback I have gotten from almost every investor with whom I have spoken. It’s probably a familiar line to thousands of entrepreneurs out there who think their (nonexistent) website or app is the next disruptive web or mobile startup (eh-hem, guilty). I know I sound like every other douchebag wantrepreneur, but what is a college hopeful to do?

Luckily, I happen to know a senior IT guy at a software company that rode the wave of ebooks in the early 2000s (my old man), so I sat down with him to talk about my realistic technology needs in the next 12 months. Over dinner, he drew me this picture:

_sidenote:_ dad, if you’re reading this, age is only in the numbers!

Okay so, he’s not an artist, but he is a pretty good information architect. I followed this draft of our computer system as he drew it, but what I picked out of the conversation was that there were a host of different skill sets involved in each component. So I asked followup questions to pinpoint how many people it would take to create and maintain such a system as it scaled. Eventually, we came up with a list of about six people who would be required to run the operation at a fairly large scale. That list is below, but the real point here is that you can’t start a technology enabled business without a technical cofounder. In the back of my head, I knew this, but I didn’t want to face it because it means my efforts to move forward will be stifled until I can find said code-slinger and enlist him or her.   
So… the hunt is on.
