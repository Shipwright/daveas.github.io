# 1. Time
You have different divisions of time in your day. The highest level of categorization is where you spend your time. The lowest level is what you're doing and where.

You want as few high levels of organization as possible which means your time is not spread thin. I spend my time at "Work" "Home" and on "Projects".

# 2. Association
I have various kinds of projects and only one "projects" folder each with its own "project" list.  I have a tag for each project and for each kind of work. So I might have to "#code for my #blog" or "#cad a version of my #pipe". If I had more hierarchy I would pull out the object not the action. Blog>Code, Pipe>CAD

# 3. Tasks
This is usually where tags come in. Tags are almost always on a per-item basis.
