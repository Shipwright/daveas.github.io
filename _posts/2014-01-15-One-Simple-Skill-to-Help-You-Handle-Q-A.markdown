title: One Simple Skill to Help You Handle Q&A

After participating in the first “Open Pitch Night" hosted by [EoK](http://www.eokhq.com) and [ACG](http://theangelcapitalgroup.com) I was lucky enough to get to pitch to ACG at the end of a member meeting.

After the event had started I found out that the audience was not limited to ACG members but was in fact open to the public. During the Q&A that followed some of the **non-ACG** audience members decided to pitch into the conversation… pun intended.

### I was not in control

I thought the pitch went great. I even received one comment that my pitch had improved “one giant leap" beyond the pitch I gave last November. It felt more like one small step to me, but I was happy to hear I had improved, nonetheless. I was looking forward to the Q&A.

I expected my assumptions to be challenged in the Q&A, but I did not expect them to be challenged with such brutal force. The audiences’ questions were fairly reasonable at first but their intent seemed malicious. I guess they weren’t so much malicious as they were arrogant, or as a friend explained to me afterwards, “some people want to be the smartest person in the room".

Regardless of the intent, I strongly felt that the investors in the audience were being outspoken and underrepresented. My purpose for being there was being squandered, **and I was letting it happen.**

### How to assume command

Although this particular scenario may be uncommon in a pitch to a sophisticated investor group, this is not uncommon in general public speaking engagements. No matter where you encounter this problem it is important that you deal with it quickly and with **lethal politeness**. When you want someone to disengage, simply tell them _"I appreciate your questions and I am eager to answer them. If you will meet me after I'll e happy to answer them for you"_ - and quickly call on another audience member. Do not give them an option by saying something like "if you don't mind". It is your job as speaker to control the room. If someone is being a distraction, it is your duty to end the distraction, and to do so politely is only appropriate.

### Never show weakness!

Try not to do what I did, which was show weakness by getting emotional. I did not quiet the speaker and instead continued to engage his questions as best as I could. Big mistake! My frustration no doubt started to show. This is what you really need to avoid. Like the comedian who can't take anymore haggling, a speaker who shows frustration will lose control to the audience and the dialogue will suffer. Don’t take this advice out of context - showing vulnerability can be a good thing, but only if it is intentional.

When handling a rough crowd, or at least one rougher than anticipated, just lean in. Be kind, but be in command.   
Control the audience with lethal politeness!
