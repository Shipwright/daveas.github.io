After becoming somewhat frustrated with my current blogging service and deciding to [cultivate a more frugal lifestyle]({{site.url}}/writing/spend-less-program-more/), I decided to create a new, FREE, blog. Having recently become fairly proficient in HTML, CSS, and Ruby, I landed on Jekyll as an ideal service. Using GitHub pages, I could host my blog for free, forever, and have 100% control over how it looked and felt.

Although the project is completed, I have several "How-To" writing-posts to finish before I finish the work-post. Check back soon for a full overview of how I ditched other services and created a free blog with Jekyll.

# How-To Posts

To help other bloggers/coders out there, I have written a blog post for every change I made that varied significantly from the standard jekyll template. Many of these contain links to articles which helped me along the way. If you're thinking about creating a jekyll blog then help yourself to these guides!
