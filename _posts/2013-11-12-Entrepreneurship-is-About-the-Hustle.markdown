title: Entrepreneurship is About the Hustle

<p>As a first time entrepreneur, trying to start a business while in college, I’ve been taking advantage of every business competition I can find in Knoxville. It just so happened that two of these pitches the <a href="http://www.andersoncei.utk.edu/competitions/vol-court/">Vol Court</a> competition, and the <a href="http://www.eokhq.com/profiles/blogs/pitchresults">EoK Open Pitch Night</a> competition, both fell on the same Tuesday night. One of the judges at the first event, who had apparently been tipped to the fact that I was leaving early to catch my second pitch, commended me for hitting both competitions in one night, as he put it, “hustling, like a real entrepreneur".</p>

<p>I am familiar with hustle. I grew up playing baseball, and although I was never an excellent fielder or hitter, I stole bases like it was my job (on most teams, that was my job). As it turns out, hustling is still my job.</p>
