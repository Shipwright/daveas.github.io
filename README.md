# Hi, I'm Dave.

I generally enjoy making things. I work for a company as a designer and engineer, but I also do [freelance](http://daveas.github.io/freelance) work.

The design of my site is inspired by the sea, because I love to :sailboat:.

Special thanks to these creators for their posts & projects that I used:
