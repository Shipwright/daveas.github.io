<p>After overcommitting my time I was forced to quit playing music for Webb High School’s Young Life Club. I think it was a valuable lesson learned, so much so that I thought my comments on the subject might make a decent blog post. It feels a little uncomfortable opening up, but I hope this helps you understand a little bit more about who I am.</p>
<pre><code> Hi Everyone,

 Forgive me in advance for the crazy long email. I know its not necessary, so you don’t have to read it, but it felt important to me.

 So, this feels really lame. I wanted to tell all of you in person but it seems like it would be awkward with the quest kids there so I decided an email was best.

 I have realized that I have once again over-committed myself. You know how we all seem to have that one (or several) fatal flaws? The ones that are so part of our very nature that they serve to remind us, during moments of occasional clarity, how imperfect we are on our own? Well, thinking I can do everything is one of mine. The tipping point for me is a dangerous place. If I’m at full capacity and I add one thing, I don’t just do it poorly, I start to do everything poorly. And you guys don’t deserve a poor effort. In fact, no one does.

 I’ve been so honored to be a part of your team! I haven’t gotten to know all of you as well as I have wished, but you are truly some amazing people. I’m hopeful that I’ll get to help out at a club again, eventually. But right now, I have too much on my plate and I was forced to look down and find something to cut out.

 I’ll try to keep this short - but basically, it was not fun to choose Young Life as the thing I would cut out. Right now I am starting a business, trying to graduate, and planning a wedding. I usually don’t stop from when I wake up to when I go to bed. It’s easy for me to feel like these are all self-serving. I want to start a business, I want to graduate, I want to get married. But in my quiet time I have been reminded that we are all created with different gifts, and my gifts may not look like yours. And if they don’t, Young Life may not be the best place for me to share my gifts.

 I have a huge exam this Friday, along with the final round of a business plan competition, and I have to lead my senior lab in the afternoon. So unfortunately, I have decided its best for me to not come this Thursday. I won’t be attending on Thursday for the rest of this semester either, or for the foreseeable future.

 I am not one to usually fall short of my commitments. I hope none of you feel let down or offended! Not that you would, its probably just a silly fear of mine. But I wouldn’t have made the choice if I didn’t see it as necessary!

 I wish you all the best at club, in the lives of Webb kids, and in everything else. I hope to not be a stranger and still see you guys around sometimes! I will continue to pray for all of you at 4:44, even if I’m not in the room on Thursdays.

 Much Love Webb Team,
 Dave
