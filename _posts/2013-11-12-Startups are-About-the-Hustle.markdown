As a first time student-entrepreneur, I’ve been taking advantage of every business competition I can find in Knoxville. It just so happened that two of these pitches the [Vol Court](http://www.andersoncei.utk.edu/competitions/vol-court/) competition, and the [EoK Open Pitch Night](http://www.eokhq.com/profiles/blogs/pitchresults) competition, both fell on the same Tuesday night. One of the judges at the first event, who had apparently been tipped to the fact that I was leaving early to catch my second pitch, commended me for hitting both competitions in one night, as he put it, “hustling, like a real entrepreneur".

For some, hustle has a negative connotation and brings about the idea of a con. But that's not the kind of hustle to which this judge was referring. The judge was referring to the kind of hustle that brings about a return not through deception, but through determination.

I grew up playing baseball where hustle was an important aspect of the sport. Everyone knew that the best teams were the ones that got on and off the field the fastest - they were the ones that always hustled. Although I was never an excellent fielder or hitter, the one thing I could control was my hustle. As it turns out, that paid off because I ended up being a good runner and I eventually stole bases like it was my job (on most teams, that was my job). As it turns out, hustling is still my job. And in a job where so many factors are unknown and beyond your control - you can't control the game, but you can control the hustle. So get out there, and *hustle*.
