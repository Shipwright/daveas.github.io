As a first time entrepreneur starting a business in college, I’ve been taking advantage of every business competition I can find in Knoxville. It just so happened that two of these pitches the [Vol Court](http://www.andersoncei.utk.edu/competitions/vol-court/) competition, and the [EoK Open Pitch Night](http://www.eokhq.com/profiles/blogs/pitchresults) competition, both fell on the same Tuesday night. One of the judges at the first event, who had apparently been tipped to the fact that I was leaving early to catch my second pitch, commended me for hitting both competitions in one night, as he put it, “hustling, like a real entrepreneur".

I am familiar with hustle. I grew up playing baseball, and although I was never an excellent fielder or hitter, I stole bases like it was my job (on most teams, that was my job). As it turns out, hustling is still my job.
