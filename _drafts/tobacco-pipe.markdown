Since I started to smoke a pipe in 2010 I have wanted to design one for myself. Smoking is such an intimate and yet unchanged experience. Pipe smoking itself really hasn't changed for hundreds if not thousands of years. I found it hard to believe that modern materials and manufacturing did not have anything to add to the experience.

This project is currently underway, so as it continues I will update this post with sketches, models, renderings, prototypes, and eventually with the product itself.
