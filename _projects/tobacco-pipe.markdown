excerpt: "Since I started to smoke a pipe in 2010 I have wanted to design one for myself. Smoking is such an intimate and yet unchanged experience. Pipe smoking itself really hasn't changed for hundreds if not thousands of years. I found it hard tobelieve that modern materials and manufacturing did not have anything to add to the experience."

### Research:

There is a lot to know about pipes before you intend to make one of any kind. But to start off, I had to learn the basic parts of pipe, as pictured below:
![pipe parts]({{site.images}}{{ page.dir }}parts.jpg)[^1]

Number | Part | Function
:---: | :--- | :---
1 | Bowl | Outer wall that holds the tobacco
2 | Chamber | Space within bowl that tobacco occupies
3 | Draught Hole | Allows passage of smoke into the bore and keeps tobacco dry
4 | Shank | Section between Bowl and Stem that shelters the Mortise  
5 | Mortise | Made to fit the outside diameter of the Tennon
6 | Tennon | Made to fit the inside diameter of the Mortise
7 | Stem | Piece with protruding Tennon, connects the Shank and Mouthpiece
8 | Mouthpiece | Made to fit the lips of the smoker
9 | Lip | Ridge made to fit inside the lip or on teeth for stability
10 | Bore | The through hole for the smoke from the chamber

This project is currently underway, so as it continues I will update this post with sketches, models, renderings, prototypes, and eventually with the product itself.
