During my last summer in college I took the trip of my life and went kayaking and sailing in British Columbia, Canada through the [National Outdoor Leadership School](http://www.nols.edu/about/leadership/). I spent a lot of time thinking about my life at home, and while I was gone I read a book called [The One Thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885167776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1885167776&linkCode=as2&tag=willis0d-20), which challenged me to find the one thing I am called to do. While sailing down wind in the Strait of Georgia on a 36â€™ boat, my heart settled on the, albeit, broad concept, of turning ideas into businesses.

Down Wind Ventures, and this site godownwind co, is an experiment in self-branding. I aspire to be a serial entrepreneur and I intend to keep the name as a temporary shelter for fledgling ideas. I even hope to one day, after paying my dues and hopefully finding some success, invest in other companies under a similar name.

### These will be my next Down Wind Ventures.
