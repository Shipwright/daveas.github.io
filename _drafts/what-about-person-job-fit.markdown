Person-Job Fit
=============

Scenario:
- using a process at work
- thought i could design it better
- (let's be honest engineers, we all think that at least once a day. If not you probably have no business being an engineer) (dont think you can build a better bridge? Alright then! Please don't.)

Question:
- buzz about product-market fit, problem-solution fit, etc.
- what about person-job fit in the working world?
- or even mor granular, person-task fit?
- ex: 3 ME's 1 task - design a new process to handling X
- who do you assign it to?

Answer (hypothesis): the scale of arrangement
- micro arrangement = thoroughness
- macro arrangement = efficiency

Explanation:
- when creating a new process, you want something simple, elegant, minimal
- when auditing, or performing a new task, you may want someone more critical
