Something happens after you start programming and designing applications. You start looking at software completely differently because, for the first time, you have enough base knowledge to merit having an opinion about what works or looks good and what doesn't.

ToC:

- Programming opinions & neatness
- Love of markdown, problems with Evernote
- Leaving Evernote & using Write
- Leaving Postachio & using Jekyll
