<h3 id="starting-up">Starting Up</h3>

<p>Willow List started after the summer before my senior year of college, when I read a book called <a href="http://godownwind.co/go-down-wind">The One Thing</a>. This book challenged me to find the one overarching theme in my professional life. I decided mine had to do with something I had never done before, creating companies out of ideas. So I set out to do it before I graduated, knowing I would need a head-start going into the real world.</p>

<p>I sorted through my Evernote folder titled “Ideas for Ventures” but I wasn’t compelled by any of the hundreds of ideas within. Instead, inspiration came at the dinner table with my girlfriend (now <a href="http://godownwind.co/my-engagement-story">fiancé</a>) and our two friends, Natalie and Chase. Nat and Chase were talking about registering because they were to be engaged soon. They mentioned they would not add an espresso machine to their list because of cost. A lightbulb went off because I had been reading about Kickstarter earlier in the day. I thought a registry where each item was it’s own Kickstarter campaign was a pretty fresh idea.</p>

<p>I started looking into the industry, signing up for one of every registry I could find eventually losing count around 30. I realized there were a load of pain points in the industry - 90’s scanner guns, duplicate gifts, limited selections, clunky UX and ugly UI. This was it. I could convince a few other people, and together we would create a better registry. How hard could it be?</p>

<h3 id="running-along">Running Along</h3>

<p>Fast forward several months and we now had a CTO, a few senior business partners, and Tennessee’s best wedding resource The Pink Bride as a partner. We had a business model wherein we did two things incredibly well. The first was to “crowd-fund” individual products on a registry, and second was to deliver these products to the end customer.</p>

<p>Through personal experience and discussions with potential investors we came to realize that the crowd-funding feature would quickly become a commodity feature amongst our competitors. But the real problem in the business model came from the inability to deliver products. So we came up with a hypothesis - that we could order these products through affiliate marketing links (links that when clicked throw a few bucks from following purchases back to the one who shared the link). We tested that hypothesis and realized that the model wouldn’t really work for various reasons. So, we decided to “pivot” and go in a new direction. Our next hypothesis was that regional stores had the capacity to ship products and pay a similar kickback to us. We also loved the idea of supporting local business and creating a more unique registry experience. As it turns out, our second hypothesis didn’t work out as we expected either. As it turns out, this stuff is pretty hard.</p>

<h3 id="winding-down">Winding Down</h3>

<p>Lacking a way to deliver products to the customer we would only be able to deliver cash, which would likely reduce our gross margins by 4-16%. With a multitude of entrenched competitors with identical features, and new entrants like <a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/2014/01/21/wedding-registry-with-zola">Zola</a> we were hard pressed to find a pivot that was worth the years of struggle that follow starting a business.</p>

<p>We looked for other pivots — new and exciting areas where we could apply what we had learned. But ultimately David (cofounder and CTO) and I agreed that we didn’t see anything that was well… worth it. We needed to see two things: <strong>huge potential in the problem</strong> (<em>business value</em>) and <strong>legitimate passion about the solution</strong> (<em>personal value</em>). In the end, we only saw one of those things everywhere we looked, so we decided the only thing to do for ourselves was call the game.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h3>

<p>I have been pleasantly surprised by my overall mood since. This happens more often than not - <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/startup-failure-by-industry">startups fail</a>. But while we failed to create a “successful” startup, we were successful in creating a great team and in learning about what to do next time.</p>

<h3 id="and-there-will-be-a-next-time">And there will be a next time!</h3>
