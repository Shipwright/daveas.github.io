After becoming somewhat frustrated with my current blogging service and deciding to [cultivate a more frugal lifestyle]({{site.url}}/writing/spend-less-program-more/), I decided to create a new, FREE, blog. Having recently become fairly proficient in HTML, CSS, and Ruby, I landed on Jekyll as an ideal service. Using GitHub pages, I could host my blog for free, forever, and have 100% control over how it looked and felt.

To help other bloggers/coders out there, I have written a blog post for every change I made that varied significantly from the standard jekyll template. Many of these contain links to articles which helped me along the way in my journey to ditch other services and create a free blog with Jekyll.
