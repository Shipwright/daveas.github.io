    It was a requirement at my high school to do a 25 hour community service project. I had a good idea I wanted to be an engineer so I decided to ask my mom (a doctor) if I could help one of her patients for whom she was making house visits. The patient was elderly and needed a wheelchair ramp in order to leave his home with his wife.

    <h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I started off by going to the house to take detailed measurements. It turns out that was a good thing because although not visible to the naked eye, the entire stoop was extremely uneven. I made sketches and took notes to bring them home to calculate the necessary dimensions of the ramp.</p>

<p>Next I had to look up all of the city, state, and federal codes regarding wheel chair ramps. There were requirements for the length of a given incline, the slope of those inclines, and the area of platforms. I factored in all of these requirements to the design. Here are some of my sketches (keep in mind this was in high school folks! I apolgoize for relatively low quality):</p>

<p>Notes:

<p>3D drawing:
<img src="/assets/images/wheelchair-ramp/Drawing.PNG" alt="drawing" /></p>

<p>The physical and code constraints were such that I had to build two ramps and a platform in between. I decided to build these such that the three parts could be assembled on site, making it easier to move them from my home to theirs. With everything in place, I drew my models again with dimensions and all, and extrapolated the requirements for materials. Every screw  was accounted for and I even optimized exact amount of each board I would have to buy in order to minimize the scrap left over from cutting.</p>

<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>

<p>I went out to both Lowe’s &amp; Home Depot for materials and explained my project to the respective managers. I asked for a discount to reduce the burden on the patient, who was already paying for the material on top of medical bills. The cost of the parts was about $500. Home Depot offered a $25 coupon, Lowe’s offered 50%. And now, thanks to their 10x generosity, I’ll shop at Lowe’s for as long as I live. Here’s what I had to buy:</p>

<p>I learned a lot of good tricks on this project like how to make sure construction proejcts are squared up properly and how to make perfect cuts with a circular saw. Here are some shots from construction:</p>

<p>Checking the railing for vertical alignment:

<p>What was a 25 hour requirement ended up being 50 in design, construction, and installation and at least another 20-25 from my dad during construction and installation. Before the proejct I could use a drill and a saw but my use lacked elegance. Afterwards, I felt like a professional, on my way to being a craftsman. I knew I was far from it, but it was enough that I decided to become an engineer. You can see some pictures below from the construction phase that show the different techniques we used to ensure part quality.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>My dad and I loved working on this project together and it was a sweet moment when the installation went perfectly. Everything fit and it looked fantastic. And most importantly, this family could now leave their home and experience the world again.</p>
