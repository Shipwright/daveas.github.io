By way of a mutual friend I was introduced to one of the better known developers (among entrepreneurial circles) in Nashville. We met up at Pinewood Social (which rocks by the way) to talk about Willow List.

I laid out what we did and how we planned to do it. This included two parts.
1. adding products to a registry online and collecting payment  
2. once funded, ordering products to send to customers

We talked and eventually decided that #1 was simple. There was basically one way to do it and it would be fairly easy, but #2 was more complex. Products could be ordered online in three ways: by a person through a website, by a program through a website, or by a program using a "back door" like an API.

The back door method is ideal because it's automatic and therefore scalable. But it would require API access which wasn’t likely to be granted to a no-name startup. The method of using a program to emulate a user would be very complex as the process would very by website, and the sites may eventually recognize the volume as a bot and shut us out. The problem with doing it with people is that the manual process doesn't scale, but to test the idea, it seemed like the most valid path. So we crunched some mental numbers and figured I could probably do it by paying a few friends in pizza and beer for a night of ordering for at least 3-6 months.

And so, we were back to bootstrapping. I knew in the back of my head that we didn’t need a $500k raise but it’s easy to get caught up in that mindset. Lesson learned: when you’re this early (say, year one) bootstrapping is always the answer.
