I have recently started to pick up some web design and web development skills because I want to create my own web applications. I was learning with [One Month Rails](http://mbsy.co/9tG6V) and using a program called BetterSnapTool[^1] to organize my desktop in a way that fit how I wanted to learn.

In the preferences section you can create custom keyboard shortcuts to make this a much more useful application. Highlighted in green, I assigned [opt]+[#] to snap the window to a [quadrant](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/plane3.htm).

### I love an organized desktop!

Adding those shortcuts made it easy to arrange the windows so I am 1-click away from any window. Sure I could swipe over with full screen apps or use cmd+tab to switch between active apps, but I found this to be by far the most effective workflow.
