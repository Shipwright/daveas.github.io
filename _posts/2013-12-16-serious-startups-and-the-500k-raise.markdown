I’ve been seeking advice on our business plan from a few locals. My conversations have led to the concept of a $500k raise this year, going full force and hiring at least 6 more people within the next 6 months. Additionally, we’ll be outsourcing the development of our core product to a company in Nashville. Being my first time in the business, I decided I should ask a man whom, whether he knows it or not, I consider to be a mentor.

You know that old guy you meet at a country store or a bar who speaks in self-coined phrases? Imagine if that guy always wore a suit, had a PhD and nearly two dozen patents, smiled like a sly politician but talked like a friendly pastor. The imagine in your head looks a lot like my mentor.

I called him and one other man to ask what they thought. The conversation with my mentor went like this:

> “So that’s the plan, what do you think?"  
“What do _you_ think?"  
“I think it sounds like a lot."  
“I think it sounds like you’re trying to take all of France."  
“What do you mean?"  
“You need a beachhead - a way to make sure you can get your feet on the ground. If you take France all at once you’ll be dead before you hit the ground."

The best advice is _free_.

Regardless, this will remain the plan at least for now. I don’t know how what our beach head will be, but I will definitely try to find out. In the meantime, I don’t think anyone would ever give us $500k anyway, so I’ll hold off for a while on meeting investors.
