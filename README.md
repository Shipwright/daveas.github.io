# Hi, I'm Dave.

I generally enjoy making things. I work for a company as a designer and engineer, but I also do [freelance](http://daveaseeman.com/freelance) work.

Please ignore the ugliness of this codebase. This was my first Jekyll site and the codebase is full of, well, lessons learned! If you want to see something a little prettier, check out my Jekyll Theme, [Jekyll Rig](http://github.com/daveaseeman/jekyll-rig)
